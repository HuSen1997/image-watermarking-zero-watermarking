## Base file for image watermarkng



The code reproduction uses the same method as in the paper.  Maybe have simplify some encryption algorithms and have little effect on the performance of watermarking algorithm. Have minor differences between the papper data and my reproduction data, due to the operating environment, encryption algorithms, secret keys, parameters, my misunderstandings, etc.
